# social-network-api
Week 18 Homework
This week's project was to build an social network API that allows users to share their thoughts, create a list of friends, and react to their friends posts. We will utilize Express.js, Mongoose packages, and moments to time/date stamp each post. Using Imsonia, we willc reate our own data with our API.
